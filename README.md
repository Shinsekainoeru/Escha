# New Anime Challenge Platform
Do you know about anime challenges on myanimelist? Well, I am inspired to create an anime challenge for myself.

The challenge is simple. You watch anime as many as you can and satisfy the episodes milestone condition every day given a function depending on each difficulty in a length of one year (from 1st January this year to 1st January next year on exactly 00:00 AM).
But you have a limitation: You can only add up to 3 anime on the currently watched list.

Feel free to download and use this but please note that I created this only for myself. The reason why I uploaded this on github is because I need backup files as much as possible because I'm autistic and too scared to lose my anime database that I developed in years. I'd be happy if someone give me an idea. Perhaps I will also create a platform for other people with their own rules if they demand it and/or give me an incentive.

Also, this project is my training ground for my programming skill. Feel free to criticize me.
